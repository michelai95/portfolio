            <p className={styles.brandStatement}>I’m a junior full stack developer who’s passionate about helping others bring their digital visions to life.<br />
                My interest in development started when I was younger but didn’t reignite until recently when I helped software engineers find new careers.<br />
                My passion stems from being able to help people connect on a global level by providing tools that make day to day tasks more efficient.<br />
                I’m excellent at meeting deadlines, love collaborating with a team, as well as building detailed projects.
